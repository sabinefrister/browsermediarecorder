This project is a browser media recorder using the Web Media Devices API. 

It can record anything inside a browser tab, eg. a web seminar or a podcast. It only works with Chrome choosing one Chrome Tab. After naming the file, the media file can be downloaded to the users computer. The codec of the media file is opus in a MP4 container. 

The browser media recorder is supported only by Chrome. It is not working with Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Internet Explorer due to the unsupported audio recording.
